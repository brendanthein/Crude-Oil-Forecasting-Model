**Objective**:
The objective of this project was to develop a forecasting model that gives a prediction of global crude oil prices in dollars per barrel using Brent-Europe crude oil data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
This specific forecast model gives a prediction 154 weeks into the future.

**Method**:
1. Ensure that data set is clean and in appropriate format for data wrangling.
2. Visually analyze the characterstics of the raw data.
3. Separate the data into training and test sets.
4. Fit appropriate model using training set.
5. Test fitted model and determine effectiveness using accuracy measures.
6. Evaluate model using residual analysis and pontmanteau tests.

**Results:** 
The result of the forecasting model will be its effectiveness in predicting crude oil prices
